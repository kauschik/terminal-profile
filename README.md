# Terminal Profile

![terminal](./terminal-profile.png)

This is my profile for Linux desktop

These commands were last tested on May 2023 on Linux Mint 21.1 Cinnamon Edition.

# Prerequisites

For the scripts to work, I think these are the bare minimum requirements.

```bash
# Update your software repositories.
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

# Install Git.
sudo apt-get install -y git

# Install Vim.
sudo apt-get install -y vim
```

# Installation

### Powerline (and fonts)

First, we'll install the font (RobotoMono for Powerline). I'll also install it into VIM, since that
is my built-in editor of choice (but you don't have to use it).

The Powerline fonts also include special characters (like Git branches) that we will use later in
the terminal profile theme.

```bash
./install_powerline.sh
```

### ZSH, OhMyZSH and Plugins

The shell that I use is "ZSH", with the OhMyZSH upgrade on top of that. To install all of that stuff,
you can run the helper script (and may need to restart after).

```bash
./install_terminal.sh
```

After this, the terminal should look a bit different, but we need to do the next step to have the
entire theme.

### Profile (plugins, theme, font and color)

This script will first install two plugins that I like to use: auto-complete and color highlighting.

```bash
# You don't need to execute this - it's part of the script already.
(cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins && git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)
(cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins && git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
```

It will also copy over the `.zshrc` and `pixegami-agnoster.zsh-theme` files for the
terminal to use (which will wire up the plugins and the theme).

The last command is to create a terminal profile that will set the colors and also set the font
to be the Powerline one we installed earlier (required for the theme to display correctly).

```bash
./install_profile.sh
```

> You can also change the font to any of the other [Powerline Patched Fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) too if you don't like RobotoMono.

If it looks funky after this command, then you might need to wait until the theme is updated with a
Powerline font (the next step), and may need to also restart your machine.


## Notes

How to dump current terminal profiles.

```bash
dconf dump /org/gnome/terminal/legacy/profiles:/ > gnome-terminal-profiles.dconf
```

How to display terminal information (I use [Neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch)).

```bash
sudo apt-get install neofetch

# Display the profile
# I override the colors because the default red is kinda ugly in this theme.
neofetch --ascii_colors 6 7 --colors 2 2 2 2
```
